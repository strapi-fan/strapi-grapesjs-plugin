This section covers the way how to configure your environment if you want to contribute to this package.

### Setting up the environment

In order to start making changes in the plugin you first need to install Strapi infrastructure on top of the plugin repository.

```
npx create-strapi-app --quickstart strapi
cd strapi
```

By default Strapi does not create plugins folder so we need to create it.

```
mkdir -p src/plugins
```

Now we should clone this repository so we can work on it.

```
git clone git@github.com:vijay94/strapi-grapejs-plugin.git src/plugins/strapi-grapejs-plugin
```

Let's add an entry inside `./package.json` file so, we won't need to use `yarn` inside plugin itself.

```
"workspaces": ["./src/plugins/strapi-grapejs-plugin"]
```

Install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Now we need to register plugin so strapi can use it. In order to do that we need
to create (if not already created) `./config/plugins.js` file and add entry to it.

```
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  "grape-editor": {
    enabled: true,
    resolve: "./src/plugins/strapi-grapejs-plugin",
    config: {
      plugins: []
    }
  }
});
```

Rebuild the project and start the server:

```
yarn build
yarn develop
```
